Handtossed Supreme Pizza

1: Crust (string) = handtossed_dough
2: Toppings (string) = ["pepperoni", "it_saausage", "green_peppers", "mushrooms", "red_onion"]
3: time_due (datetime) = call_in_order = 15
4: marinara_sauce (boolean) = true

1: Customer inputs they want handtossed dough
2: customer asks for a supreme pizza, which has those Toppings
3: Customer called in an order for carryout, which is generally 15 minutes based on store volume
4: Pizza comes with marinara_sauce by default, therefore this boolean defaults to true unless otherwise specified.
